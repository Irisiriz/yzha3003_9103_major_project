# 1. Project Description
This is the IDEA9103 Major Project individual task. The owner of this repository is **yzha3003**. Our group chose **Piet Mondrian's Broadway Boogie Woogie** as our artwork. Based on this, I used **Perlin Noise** as the main animation driver to create smooth, natural, and irregular changes. The goal is to simulate the feeling of city streets at night, with building lights gently changing and LED signs flickering.

# 2. Interaction Instruction
No interaction is required. Simply open the page, and the animation will start automatically. Over time, small squares along the yellow lines gently change in brightness, and vertical bars appear inside coloured big blocks.

# 3. Details of Individual Approach
- ### Method
I chose Perlin Noise as the main technique to drive my individual animation. It creates smooth and natural variations over time, which I used to simulate the feeling of lights flickering and glowing in a city at night.
